# OxyHandmade

This project is a landing web document that promotes one of my mother's hobbies and side hustles. Making handmade bows and ribbons.
She is crafting them for some years and she seems to enjoy it. I thought that this project is suitable for the 2nd laboratory work on Web programming

## Code structure and design decisions

The code structure is done in a modular way: `index.html`, `css/`, `img/`, `fonts/` directories are created per file type.

The css files are organised in component based structure. This structure ensures that styles are organised per category, 
which makes the styles modular, organized and readable. Learned it while studying preprocessors and sticked to it till now.

`styles.css` serves only as an entry point where all the styles are imported

Outfit font variations were downloaded from Google fonts and compressed using the [Google's woff2 compressor](https://github.com/google/woff2). 
Compressing fonts allow them to download faster
